What a Bit is: Bits are like tiny switches in a computer that can be either on (1) or off (0).

Binary Numbers: Binary is a way of counting using 0s and 1s, and it's the foundation of all digital data in computers.

Bitwise Operations:

AND Operation (&): Compares two bits and returns 1 only if both bits are 1.
OR Operation (|): Compares two bits and returns 1 if at least one bit is 1.
XOR Operation (^): Compares two bits and returns 1 if the bits are different.
NOT Operation (~): Inverts the bits (0 becomes 1, and 1 becomes 0).
Shifting Bits:

Left Shift (<<): Moves the bits to the left and fills the new spaces with 0.
Right Shift (>>): Moves the bits to the right and fills the new spaces with either 0 or 1, depending on the type of shift.
Practical Applications:

Checking odd or even numbers using AND.
Creating flag systems for options using OR.
Memory allocation and management.
Compact storage and efficient manipulation of data.
Solving puzzles and coding challenges.
Converting Numbers:

You learned how to convert between binary, decimal (base 10), hexadecimal (base 16), and octal (base 8) representations.
