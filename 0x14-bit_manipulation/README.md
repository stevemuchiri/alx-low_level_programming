Bit manipulation is a powerful technique in computer programming that involves manipulating individual bits within binary representations of data. In binary, each digit is a bit, and these bits can be either 0 or 1. Bit manipulation allows programmers to perform various operations at the bit level, providing an efficient and compact way to work with data.
